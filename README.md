# Snooker_App

Welcome to my Snooker Simulation App, a digital simulation of the traditional snooker game. This programme, designed to deliver a near-authentic snooker experience, uses easy mouse-based cue controls and realistic physics to engage players in the strategic complexity of snooker.

## Features

* Multiple Game Modes: The app provides users with different game modes, including Normal Mode, Random Mode, Random Red Mode, and Random Gravity Mode. Each mode offers a distinct gameplay experience and challenges.
* Interactive User Interface: The user interface (UI) includes buttons that allow users to switch between game modes effortlessly. This intuitive design ensures a seamless transition from one mode to another.
* Physics Simulation: The core of the application is its physics simulation engine. It accurately replicates the behavior of objects, including balls, based on principles like restitution and friction, providing a realistic gaming experience.
* Customizable Gravity: In Random Gravity Mode, users can experience varying gravitational forces that add an extra layer of complexity to the gameplay. The ability to set random gravity values keeps the game engaging and unpredictable.
* Colorful Visuals: The application boasts vibrant and colorful graphics, with balls of different colors that add to the visual appeal. This feature enhances the overall aesthetics of the game.
* Cue Ball Movement: The application allows users to control the cue ball's direction and force when setting up shots. This adds an element of skill and strategy to the gameplay.
* In-Game Feedback: The app provides feedback to users, such as when a ball is pocketed or when the game mode changes. This feedback keeps players informed about the current state of the game.

## How to Play
* Select game mode using keybord or button
* Aim by clicking and dragging the mouse away from the cue ball; the direction and length of the drag determine the aim and power of the shot.
* Release the mouse button to take the shot.

## Random Gravity Mode
* Dynamic Gameplay: Users will notice that the balls on the billiards table are influenced by changing gravitational forces. The balls may move in unexpected directions or trajectories due to the fluctuating gravity.
* Realistic Challenge: This mode adds an element of unpredictability and challenge to the gameplay. Players must adapt to the changing gravity to make successful shots and pocket the balls.
* Variable Gravitational Forces: Unlike traditional billiards, where the gravitational force is constant, the "Random Gravity Mode" introduces variability. In this mode, the gravitational force acting on the balls changes at regular intervals.
